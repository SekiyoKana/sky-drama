## LTX Prompt Template: Flowing Narrative
**Prompt:**
A fluffy golden retriever puppy runs towards the camera through a field of tall green grass. The grass sways violently in the wind, and dandelion seeds float through the air. The camera tracks backwards at a low angle, maintaining focus on the puppy's happy face while the background blurs due to speed. The lighting is golden hour sunshine creating lens flares.

**Negative Prompt:**
worst quality, blurry, distorted, morphing, shaky camera, static image, watermark, text.

**Breakdown (Why it works):**
- **Unified Flow:** LTX performs best when descriptions flow logically rather than being list-like.
- **Environmental Dynamics:** "Grass sways violently," "seeds float" — LTX needs explicit instructions to animate the background, otherwise it tends to freeze it.
- **Camera-Subject Relation:** "Tracks backwards... maintaining focus" tells LTX exactly how to calculate the parallax.

## LTX Prompt Template: Atmospheric Portrait
**Prompt:**
A young woman with blue eyes looks directly into the lens. Her hair gently flutters in a soft breeze. The lighting is cinematic and moody, creating a chiaroscuro effect on her face. The camera performs a very subtle, slow push-in to emphasize her emotional expression. Dust particles dance in the light beams in the background.

**Key Elements:**
- **Micro-Motion:** "Hair gently flutters," "Dust particles dance" prevents the "mannequin effect" (死人脸) common in video models.
- **Restraint:** "Subtle, slow push-in" prevents LTX from generating excessive, dizzying camera movements.
