## Wan Prompt Template: Motion-Focus
**Prompt:**
**Subject:** A cyberpunk samurai robot with glowing neon circuitry.
**Scene:** A rainy futuristic rooftop at night, cyberpunk city skyline in the background.
**Motion:** The robot draws a katana in slow motion, rain droplets suspended in the air, then slashes forward rapidly.
**Camera:** Dynamic tracking shot following the blade movement, 360-degree orbit.
**Quality:** 4k, high quality, hyper-realistic, fluid motion.

**Breakdown (Why it works):**
- **Explicit Segmentation:** Using "Subject:", "Motion:" prefixes helps Wan's attention mechanism.
- **Motion Adverbs:** Words like "slow motion," "rapidly," "suspended" are crucial for Wan to control frame interpolation.
- **Camera Logic:** "Dynamic tracking" works better than vague "moving camera" descriptions.

## Wan Prompt Template: Image-to-Video (First Frame Animation)
**Prompt:**
(Input Image provided)
**Motion Description:** The waves crash violently against the lighthouse. The light beam rotates clockwise illuminating the rain.
**Camera Movement:** Pan right, slowly zooming out to reveal the stormy cliffs.
**Atmosphere:** Stormy, chaotic, high motion blur.

**Key Elements:**
- **Motion Hierarchy:** Defines primary motion (waves) vs. secondary motion (light beam).
- **Directionality:** Explicitly stating "clockwise" or "pan right" helps Wan 2.1 avoid spatial confusion.
